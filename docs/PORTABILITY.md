# Platform support and the compatibility layer

## Where things stand

Nexus was originally written directly against the Windows SDK: DirectXMath for
all vector and matrix maths, Direct3D 11 for rendering, DirectInput for input,
XAudio2 for sound, and Win32 for windowing. Those dependencies reached into
almost every header, so nothing outside Windows compiled at all.

That is no longer the case. The split now looks like this:

| Component | Windows | Linux / macOS |
|---|---|---|
| Engine headers (`include/`) | ✅ | ✅ |
| Math (`XMFLOAT3`, `XMMATRIX`, …) | ✅ SDK DirectXMath | ✅ `compat/win32/DirectXMath.h` |
| Core library `NexusCore` | ✅ | ✅ |
| ECS, components, systems | ✅ | ✅ |
| Platform layer (timing, filesystem, memory) | ✅ | ✅ |
| Scripting (Lua, Python) | ✅ | ✅ |
| Asset importers and `NexusAssetConverter` | ✅ | ✅ |
| Test suite | ✅ | ✅ |
| RHI: Vulkan backend | ✅ | ✅ (needs SDL2) |
| RHI: OpenGL backend | ✅ | ✅ (needs SDL2 + GLAD) |
| RHI: Direct3D 9 / 10 / 11 | ✅ | ❌ Windows-only by nature |
| Legacy D3D11 renderer, Win32 UI, DirectInput, XAudio2 | ✅ | ❌ see below |
| `NexusEngine` executable | ✅ | ❌ depends on the legacy renderer |

## The compatibility layer: `compat/win32/`

Added to the include path **only on non-Windows builds**. Windows keeps using
the real Windows SDK, unchanged.

### `DirectXMath.h`

A scalar, dependency-free implementation of the DirectXMath subset the engine
uses. It reproduces the original *conventions* exactly, because that is what
determines whether the renderer produces a correct image:

- Row-major storage, **row-vector** convention — a point transforms as
  `v' = v * M`, so translation lives in the fourth **row**.
- `XMMatrixMultiply(A, B)` means "apply A, then B".
- Left-handed projections, with Direct3D's `z ∈ [0, 1]` clip range.
- `XMQuaternionMultiply(q1, q2)` means "q1 then q2" — the reverse of the usual
  Hamilton product, matching the SDK.

`tests/MathTests.cpp` asserts every one of these directly. On Windows that file
compiles against the real SDK header, which makes it a conformance test of the
portable version against the original rather than a test of it against itself.

Two deliberate differences from the SDK, both strictly safer:

- Storage types (`XMFLOAT3` and friends) zero-initialise by default instead of
  leaving members uninitialised.
- Normalising a zero-length vector returns the zero vector rather than
  propagating `NaN` or infinity through the rest of the frame.

### `Windows.h` and the DirectX headers

`Windows.h` supplies the Win32 **typedefs** the engine's declarations use —
`HWND`, `HRESULT`, `DWORD`, `LARGE_INTEGER`, the `VK_*` key codes — with the
same sizes and values as the SDK.

It deliberately declares **no Win32 functions**. Anything that genuinely needs
the Windows API belongs behind `#ifdef _WIN32` or in a platform backend, and
leaving the functions undeclared keeps that boundary honest: a stray
`CreateWindowEx` call fails to compile rather than failing mysteriously at link
time.

`d3d11.h`, `d3d12.h`, `dxgi.h`, `dinput.h`, `dsound.h`, `xaudio2.h`, `xinput.h`
and friends are **declaration-only**. The COM interfaces are forward-declared
but never defined, so a pointer to one can be stored and passed — which is all
the engine's headers need — while any attempt to actually *call* a Direct3D
method off Windows is a compile error.

## What is still Windows-only, and why

`src/CMakeLists.txt` lists these under `NEXUS_WINDOWS_ONLY_SOURCES`. They call
Direct3D 11, DirectInput, XAudio2, the Kinect SDK or Win32 windowing directly —
not through a typedef, but as real API calls — so they can only be compiled
against the Windows SDK:

`GraphicsDevice.cpp`, `Texture.cpp`, `Shader.cpp`, `Mesh.cpp`,
`TextRenderer.cpp`, `LightingEngine.cpp`, `AnimationSystem.cpp`,
`ResourceManager.cpp`, `InputManager.cpp`, `AudioSystem.cpp`,
`MotionControlSystem.cpp`, `EngineUI.cpp`, `EngineUI_Modern.cpp`,
`GameImporterUI.cpp`.

`Engine.cpp`, `EngineErrorRecovery.cpp`, `NexusC.cpp` and `main.cpp` are in that
same list but are a different case: they are **portable source**. Window
creation, the window procedure and the message loop moved out of `Engine` and
into `Platform::CreateGameWindow` / `ProcessMessages`, which is where the
per-platform detail belongs — the window is the platform's, not the engine's.
What still pins them to Windows is only that they *call* the Direct3D 11
subsystems above, so they cannot be linked elsewhere yet. They are compiled on
every platform anyway by the `NexusEngineCoreCompileCheck` target in
`tests/CMakeLists.txt`, and simply never linked, so they cannot quietly drift
back into Windows-only code.

This is the pre-RHI renderer. The cross-platform path forward is the RHI
abstraction under `include/RHI/` and `src/rhi/`, which already has Vulkan and
OpenGL backends. Porting the engine's runtime onto the RHI is what would make
`NexusEngine` itself build everywhere; until then Linux and macOS build the core
library, the tools and the tests.

## Guarding against regression

Four things keep this from quietly reverting:

1. **The test suite** (`ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure`) runs on
   Windows, Linux and macOS in CI, and covers the math conventions, the ECS, the
   platform layer and the Valve asset parser.

2. **The header self-containment check** compiles every public header as the
   first include in its own translation unit. This catches the exact class of
   bug that made the engine Windows-only: a header that happens to compile
   because some *other* header included `<algorithm>` or `<d3d11.h>` first, and
   breaks the moment include order or platform changes. Two headers are skipped
   because they need third-party SDKs this repository does not ship
   (`PhysXEngine.h` needs PhysX; `AdvancedPhysicsEngine.h` needs Bullet); both
   now fail with an explicit `#error` naming the missing dependency.

3. **The combined-header check** compiles every public header into a *single*
   translation unit. Compiling headers one at a time cannot see a conflict
   *between* two of them, which is its own bug class: `Nexus::AudioSystem`,
   `Nexus::ParticleSystem` and `Nexus::AISystem` were each declared twice, with
   different definitions, so any translation unit that included both headers
   failed to compile. The ECS-side systems in `Systems.h` are now
   `AudioUpdateSystem`, `ParticleUpdateSystem` and `AIBehaviorSystem`.

4. **The engine-core compile check** builds the portable-source-but-not-yet-
   linkable translation units described above on Linux and macOS.

## Building on Linux

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential cmake libsdl2-dev libvulkan-dev
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --parallel
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

Every third-party dependency is optional. A missing one disables its feature
with a message; none of them stop the build.
